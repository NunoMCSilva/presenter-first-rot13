Presenter-First ROT13
---

Status: Working

A simple Tkinter ROT13 GUI. Write on the left side,
and the ROT13ed equivalent is shown on the right.

This is a small project written while trying to
learn the Presenter-First (PF) architecture pattern.

While this project only contains a single
Model-View-Presenter triad it should still
be useful as a reference.

Yes, there's probably some mistakes in code
organization, please remember it's a learning
project...

Running ROT13 GUI
---

After installing dependencies (I recommend using
virtualenv) type:

    python3 .

or

    python3 __main__.py

Yes, it looks weird... :(

Running ROT13 tests
-------------------

All tests can be run with pytest.
